Predict which wikipedia projects will get how many edits by day

Based on:
- news
- wikipedia views
- other time series data like weather

Start with:
- hurricanes, retrospective, jawiki.
- continue with other wikiprojects/categories.

--------------------------------------
--------------------------------------

Why is this interesting?

- wikipedia edits are a steady stream in terms of volume.
- question: how do wikipedia editors choose which articles to edit?
    - reference article about entity creation: wikipedia article creation 
    is partially related to news trends on the topic.

why is this relevant?

- Committed wikipedia contributors may want to understand edit-trends in order 
to forecast upcoming edits. This may help them plan which categories of 
articles to patrol, etc.
- Wikipedia editors' choices about what to edit are time- and effort-intensive 
personal choices, related to personal ideals and aspirations. Thus, this 
analysis provides a model of how individuals' costly personal choices driven
by intrinsic motivation can be predicted by news trends and current events. 
This model may be interesting to various institutions predicting consumers', 
students', academics', employees', and other individuals' choices related to
intrinsic motivation.

Minimal MVP Tasks:

- create table "tcyc_page_ids_and_names":
    - Table's purpose: Help generate the target_timeseries
    - Table includes: One row for each page_id / page name combo in wikiproject
    - Table's primary key (2-col pk): page_id, page name
    - Table's other columns: none
    - Table sorting: By page_id, then by page name
- create table "target_dayseries":
    - Table's purpose: hold actual targets and predicted targets
    - Table includes: One row for every day during period
    - Table's primary key: edit_day (datetime)
    - Table's other columns: 
        editcount_all_actual,        editcount_wikiproj_actual,
        editcount_all_basepreds,     editcount_wikiproj_basepreds,
        delta_all_actual_basepreds,  delta_wikiproj_actual_basepreds,
- create table "japan_cyclones":
    - Table's purpose: identify when cyclones hit Japan, to predict edits
    - Table includes: One row for every day during period
    - Table's primary key: edit_day (datetime
    - Table's other columns:
        cyc_onland,        cyc_onland_lag1to3,     cyc_onland_lag4to6
                           cyc_onland_lead1to3,    cyc_onland_lead4to6
        cyclone_severity,  cyc_severity_lag1to3,   cyc_severity_lag4to6,
                           cyc_severity_lead1to3,    cyc_severity_lead4to6



Extension concepts:
- will need to use pyspark
    - target-generation onehot tables will be sparse tables
    - 
- Categorize edits into relevant types: (controversy, self-removal, editor id)
- 
- If the same user makes multiple edits on an article within 1 hour, discard excess
- Use IP editors timezones for additional analysis
